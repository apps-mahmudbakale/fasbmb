            <p class="text-dark" style="text-align: justify;">Dear Fellows,</p>
            <p class="text-dark" style="text-align: justify;"> We are thrilled to let you know that the African sub-committee of the IUBMB Trainee Initiative will be hosting a virtual Webinar at the end of this month.</p>
            <p class="text-dark" style="text-align: justify;">The title of the webinar is: "Africa's Great Decode: Embracing Bioinformatics as a Way of the Future". The event will be on Monday 30th May at 17:00 Central African Time (CAT). We have secured two exciting guest speakers, Dr James Otieno, a Kenyan Postdoctoral Fellow based at the Fogarty International Centre in Maryland, USA, and Verena Ras, a training and outreach coordinator for H3ABioNet based in Cape Town, South Africa. I have attached here the advertisement for the webinar as well as the speaker profiles.</p>
            <p class="text-dark" style="text-align: justify">We would be very grateful if you could circulate this information to the members of the societies within the FASBMB. Registration is free and we would love to have as many people attend as possible. </p>

                    <p class="text-dark" style="text-align: justify;">Dear Fellows,</p>
                    <p class="text-dark" style="text-align: justify;"> We are a committee of emerging researchers across the
                        world who have formed a Trainee Initiative with the backing of the IUBMB, and our aim is to bring
                        together scientists from across the globe through networking and events covering educational,
                        technical, and professional development. Our leadership committee represents all geographical
                        regions by including members from all four regional IUBMB member societies: FAOBMB (Federation of
                        Asian and Oceanian Biochemists and Molecular Biologists), FASBMB (Federation of African Societies of
                        Biochemistry and Molecular Biology), FEBS (Federation of European Biochemical Societies, and PABMB
                        (Pan American Association for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology). </p>
                    <p class="text-dark" style="text-align: justify;">Currently, we have four members representing the
                        African continent. I myself am from South Africa, Oswald Djihinto from Benin, Tatenda Murigo from
                        Zimbabwe and Elodie Ekoka from Cameroon. Together we make up the African team on the IUBMB Trainee
                        Initiative Leadership Committee. </p>
                    <p class="text-dark" style="text-align: justify">This Trainee Initiative is aimed at emerging
                        researchers all around the world involved in all fields of biological and related basic sciences,
                        and anyone else who may be interested. We aim to provide opportunities for skills development,
                        training resources, networking and a supportive team to help in future professional and scientific
                        journeys. Accessibility, diversity and inclusion are most important to us and we hope to provide a
                        platform for all skill levels to navigate the wonderful world of biomolecular research. </p>
                    <p class="text-dark" style="text-align: justify;">We will be arranging free monthly online events for
                        interested researchers and we would like to encourage as many postgrads and post-doctoral fellows as
                        possible to attend these events. Our very first event will be held on 30th March 2022. Attached is a
                        flyer advertising this event and includes the talk abstracts and a sign-up/registration link for the
                        webinar. It will be a Zoom webinar featuring Dr David Baker and Dr Brian Koepnick, and will look at
                        protein structure prediction and design, and how Rosetta and Foldit can be used to investigate
                        COVID-19. (Please take note that the flyer advertises Pacific Standard time (PST) and Central
                        European Time (CET) as this is a global event â€“ hopefully there won't be any confusion).</p>
                    <p class="text-dark">Anyone interested can sign up to attend, for free! Just follow the link on the
                        flyer or scan the QR code to register.</p>
                    <p class="text-dark" style="text-align: justify;"> We also encourage those interested to follow our
                        Twitter and Instagram accounts (@iubmb_trainee), and if anyone wishes to find out more about the
                        IUBMB Trainee Initiative and the committee members, they can take a look at our webpage: <a

                        has a wonderful YouTube channel with lots of great videos. Here is a link to one she posted about
